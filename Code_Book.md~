Getting and cleaning data Project

Below is a description of the code and description of an anlysis to generate a tidy data set for an specific source. The data was obtained from:

The Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set a study where physical activities where recorded, using smartphones, for several subjects.

The first step is to obtain the files withthe raw data:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

After downloading the file it is unzipped and a folder named "UCI_HAR_Dataset" is created. Then an R-scrip file "run_analysis.R" is copied to this folder.

The data that was read was:

subject_text.txt
subject_train.txt
y_test.txt
y_train.txt
X_test.txt
X_train.txt
features.txt
activiy_labels.txt

Below is the decsription for each of the files used, from the README.txt of the original source:

features.txt: List of all features or activities recorded.
activity_labels.txt: Links the class labels with their activity name.

train/X_train.txt: Training set.
train/y_train.txt: Training labels.

test/X_test.txt: Test set.
test/y_test.txt: Test labels.

- read.table(file_path, header = TRUE) #if they used some other way of saving the file than a default write.table, this step will be different
